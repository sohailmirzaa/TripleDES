# TripleDES
Internship project

In this project I have learned alot about encryption and decryption techniques used in the past as the technology got advanced throughout the year malicious hackers are getting advanced too. It is advisable to have proper encryption and decryption techniques to make the user experience secure and reliable. In the past 100 years encryption was used to encrypt secret messages using ciphertext.These ciphertext were unique and can't be easy to decode at that era but as humans evolved and people got more curious they found solutions to the ciphertext as well.in the modern era now people use private and public key to encrypt and decrypt the message or any other file.
In this project we have implemented Triple DES. which is a very popular method of encryption and decryption to store password to encrypt files. It is nowadays a popular method.

This internship is carried out in exposys data labs.As i am computer science student i have keen interest in cybersecurity i learn cybersecurity on day today basis and i can understand this project very well how much impact it has in the real world.

This project is built using python 3 and all the source code and related documents will be linked in this report.
